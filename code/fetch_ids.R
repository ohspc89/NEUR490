# folder    | content
# --------------------
# codes     | R codes
# processed | code output
# docs      | relevant documents

# Folder structure was as follows:

# NEUR490
# |-- code                  << this is the working directory I worked in
# |   |-- fetch_ids.R
# |   |-- perform_qc.R
# |   |-- qc_functions.R
# |-- processed
# |-- docs
# |   |-- pdf/json files

# When my working directory is 'code', one level up is 'NEUR490'.
# '../processed/reference.tsv' == 'NEUR490/processed/reference.tsv'

# I also explained in 'Adapting_the_code.pdf'
# One note I missed was that you need to have "processed" folder created
# before running the last line, or you will get an error.


#Notes for code
#in order to see exactly which rows your script is pikcing up run
#print(head(m345, 3)) 
#in the directoy - it will output what the script is picking up - you can change the 3 to add more rows.
