This repository is prepared to share R scripts prepared to conduct quality checks on .txt files, output of ELAN video processing.

There are three different quality checks performed:

1. Unique last offsets

2. Identical previous event's offset and the subsequent event's onset (continuous coding)

3. Properly formatted labels (capitalized & belong to the list of pre-approved labels)

Running R scripts of this repository requires the synchronization of Microsoft OneDrive folder to your local computer.
